## Hello! Welcome to the [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md) TTRPG Community. We're glad to have you. ðŸ‘‹

## About The Obsidian TTRPG Community ðŸŽ²
This organization exists as a community for Obsidian TTRPG players, game-masters, and enthusists alike. We're here to be the one-stop shop for you to find many of the resources you need to augment your TTRPG configuration within Obsidian.

### Goals

The Obsidian TTRPG Community Maintains multiple goals.

- Encouraging the collection and categorization of data shared on **[Obsidian Discord](https://discord.gg/obsidianmd)** that would otherwise become lost and forgotten over time. The primary repository for these miscellaneous elements is the [Obsidian TTRPG Share](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/ObsidianTTRPGShare)
- Act as an incubator for refining those elements, so they may be added to the **[Obsidian TTRPG Hub](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/for+TTRPG)** or other relevant spaces.
3. Serve as a space for identifying and growing in-need TTRPG communities who lack adequate resources within the Obsidian Community through our ongoing SRD/Starter Vault Conversion Project.
4. Maintain a master list of quality resources for TTRPG players and Game-Masters that coordinate well with Obsidian.

## Want to Help Out, Or Lurk? ðŸ«¶

While it is not expected, many of us wanted to give back to the TTRPG users who came after this, and this community is part of the result. If you are feeling the call to give back, then please message **Sigrunixia**, **Prostachio**, or **Josh Plunkett/Sklore** for an invite to higher level access. Once in, this readme will change, and you will be able to see what projects are currently most in need of help along with other updates. However, you are not limited to that. Want to create a project that you are passionate about? Go right ahead! We just ask you *commit* (Hah, puns!) to working on it and ask for help from the community in completing it. 

### Vault Projects ðŸ“Œ

As a heads up, vault-based projects have higher levels of standards and scrutany than other projects. We wish to maintain the highest levels of ethics we can within this community, and thus all vault-based projects, and materials, must pass legal muster. If it does not, we will not host it nor assist with it. Those vaults would be best kept private in your own repo.
